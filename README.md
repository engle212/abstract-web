# Abstract
Abstract is a real-time web application that provides a simpler way for people to invest. The vision of this project is to abstract away from the traditional model of investment: scrambling to buy and sell at the best times. This is done by giving users high-level choices, providing options for pre-defined algorithmic strategies.

## Installation

For developers wanting to run the app locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Supply all of the needed environment variables.
3. Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile.
4. Run the container.
5. Open the localhost URL in a browser.
