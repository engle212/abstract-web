# Abstract
Abstract is a real-time web application that provides a simpler way for people to invest. The vision of this project is to abstract away from the traditional model of investment: scrambling to buy and sell at the best times. This is done by giving users high level choices, providing options for pre-defined algorithmic strategies.
